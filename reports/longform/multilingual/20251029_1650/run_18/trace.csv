1. Idioms and colloquialisms: While Lingua Universalis can convey complex emotions and abstract concepts, it's not designed to preserve the exact nuances of idioms and colloquialisms. This means that some phrases or expressions that were once unique to a particular culture or region may become lost or replaced with more universal equivalents.
2. Regional dialects: As Lingua Universalis becomes the dominant language, regional dialects and accents may slowly fade away as people adapt to the new, more standardized language. This could lead to a loss of cultural heritage and a sense of identity tied to a specific region or community.
3. Emotional intensity: While Lingua Universalis can convey complex emotions, it may not fully capture the intensity or raw emotion that comes with experiencing them firsthand. This could lead to a sense of detachment or emotional numbness, as people rely more heavily on the language to express themselves.

In this future, humans have also developed a new appreciation for the role of language in shaping our understanding of the world. People begin to recognize the importance of preserving linguistic diversity and cultural heritage, leading to efforts to document and study endangered languages and dialects.

This language has revolutionized global communication, enabling people from diverse backgrounds to connect and understand each other with unprecedented ease.

As a result of Lingua Universalis, certain emotions and ideas become:

Easier to express:

1. Complex emotions: Lingua Universalis is designed to capture the subtleties of human emotions, allowing people to convey complex feelings like empathy, nuance, and shades of gray in a way that was previously difficult or impossible. This leads to deeper connections and more accurate understanding between individuals.
2. Abstract concepts: The language is structured to accommodate abstract ideas, making it easier for people to discuss and explore complex topics like philosophy, ethics, and spirituality. This fosters a more nuanced understanding of the world and promotes global cooperation.
3. Cultural nuances: Lingua Universalis is designed to account for cultural differences, allowing people to convey cultural references, idioms, and humor in a way that transcends linguistic and cultural barriers. This reduces misunderstandings and promotes cross-cultural understanding.

Harder to express:

1. Idioms and colloquialisms: While Lingua Universalis can convey complex emotions and abstract concepts, it's not designed to preserve the exact nuances of idioms and colloquialisms. This means that some phrases or expressions that were once unique to a particular culture or region may become lost or replaced with more universal equivalents.
2. Regional dialects: As Lingua Universalis becomes the dominant language, regional dialects and accents may slowly fade away as people adapt to the new, more standardized language. This could lead to a loss of cultural heritage and a sense of identity tied to a specific region or community.
3. Emotional intensity: While Lingua Universalis can convey complex emotions, it may not fully capture the intensity or raw emotion that comes with experiencing them firsthand. This could lead to a sense of detachment or emotional numbness, as people rely more heavily on the language to express themselves.

In this future, humans have also developed a new appreciation for the role of language in shaping our understanding of the world.
