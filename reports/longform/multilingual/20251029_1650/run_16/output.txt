As Dr. Patel's words flowed through the translator's earpiece, Maya's fingers flew across the keyboard, capturing the nuances of his speech with precision. She had worked with the renowned astrophysicist on several occasions, and their conversations had always been professional, yet friendly.

But this meeting was different. Today, they were discussing a groundbreaking discovery that could change the course of human understanding. Maya found herself getting lost in Dr. Patel's eyes, the way they sparkled with excitement as he spoke of black holes and wormholes.

As she translated, Maya's mind began to wander. She thought about the way Dr. Patel's hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck, the way his voice dropped to a low rumble when he was passionate about his work. She felt a flutter in her chest, and her fingers stumbled over the words.

"Ah, pardon, Dr. Patel?" she said, trying to rewind a few seconds. "I think there might be a slight misunderstanding. You said'gravity warps space-time,' but I'm not sure that's what you meant."

Dr. Patel's brow furrowed. "No, no, I'm quite certain. Gravity warps space-time, yes, yes."

Maya's eyes met his, and for a moment, they locked in a silent understanding. She felt a spark of electricity, and her heart skipped a beat. But then she shook her head, refocusing on the task at hand.

"I think we might need to clarify that point, Dr. Patel. Perhaps you could rephrase?"

As they delved deeper into the conversation, Maya found herself struggling to keep her emotions in check. She stumbled over words, and Dr. Patel's patience began to wear thin. But she couldn't help it – she was falling for him, hard.

As the meeting drew to a close, Maya's fingers trembled as she typed out the final notes. She glanced up to find Dr. Patel watching her, his eyes warm with a newfound intensity.

"Thank you, Maya," he said, his voice low and husky. "You're an excellent translator. And... a valuable colleague."

Maya's cheeks flushed as she smiled, her heart racing. She knew she had to be careful – she was her client's translator, not his confidante. But as she packed up her things and bid Dr. Patel farewell, she couldn't shake the feeling that their linguistic connection was about to become a whole lot more complicated.
