The city was bustling with activity as the sun began to set on another day. But amidst the chaos, a peculiar phenomenon was about to occur. Every day, without fail, gravity would cease to function for exactly one minute, allowing objects to float and people to defy the forces of nature.

Ava and Ethan, a young couple, had grown accustomed to this daily anomaly. They had learned to plan their lives around it, finding creative ways to make the most of their 60 seconds of weightlessness.

As the minute approached, Ava and Ethan made their way to the rooftop of their apartment building. They had set up a makeshift trampoline, and the couple eagerly waited for the gravity to disappear.

The countdown began, and the air seemed to vibrate with anticipation. Then, suddenly, the world around them began to distort and blur. Objects floated off the ground, and the pair felt the familiar sensation of weightlessness.

Ava giggled as she floated above the trampoline, her long hair streaming behind her like a golden ribbon. Ethan grinned, his eyes shining with excitement, as he bounced up and down, his arms outstretched.

Together, they played a game of zero-gravity tag, chasing each other around the rooftop, laughing and shouting. They spun and twirled, their movements becoming more carefree and fluid as the seconds ticked by.

As the minute drew to a close, Ava and Ethan reluctantly drifted back down to the trampoline, their faces flushed with joy. They collapsed onto the surface, holding hands and gazing up at the sky.

"This is our favorite part of the day," Ava said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ethan nodded, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "It's like we're in our own little world, where nothing else matters."

As the gravity began to return, the couple slowly stood up, still holding hands. They gazed out at the city, watching as the world slowly came back into focus.

Ava turned to Ethan, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "You know what we should do tomorrow?"

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "What's that?"

"We should pack a picnic and eat it on the rooftop during the gravity-free minute," Ava said, her voice full of excitement.

Ethan's face lit up. "That's genius! We can use the time to float above the city, with a blanket and a basket of food. It'll be like having our own private sky picnic."

Ava grinned, feeling a thrill of anticipation. "It'll be the most romantic thing we've ever done."

As they descended the stairs, hand in hand, they couldn't help but wonder what other adventures they would have during their daily minute of weightlessness.
