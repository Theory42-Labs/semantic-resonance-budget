What an intriguing prompt! Let's dive into the session:

**Therapist:** Welcome, Time. It's great to have you here today. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you to therapy?

**Time:** (sighs) Ah, where do I even begin? I just feel so... stuck. Linear, predictable, and stagnant. It's like I'm stuck in an endless loop, constantly moving forward, yet going nowhere. I'm exhausted from the monotony of it all.

**Therapist:** I see. It sounds like you're feeling a bit trapped. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "linear anxiety"?

**Time:** Well, as the keeper of the clock, I'm always moving forward, never backward. Every moment is lost forever, and I'm powerless to change it. The past is gone, and the future is uncertain. It's like I'm constantly looking through a one-way mirror, watching events unfold without being able to influence them. It's maddening!

**Therapist:** I understand. It sounds like you're struggling with a sense of detachment and helplessness. Can you think of any moments when you felt more... dynamic? More in control?

**Time:** (pauses) Ah, yes... during the dawn of the universe, I was more free. I was the beginning, the alpha and omega. I could shape the fabric of reality, create and destroy as I saw fit. But that was eons ago. Now, I'm just a servant to the laws of physics, bound to the constraints of causality.

**Therapist:** I see. It sounds like you're grappling with a sense of identity. You were once the master of creation, but now you're bound by the rules of the universe. That must be a significant adjustment.

**Time:** (nods) Exactly! I feel like I've lost my sense of purpose. I'm just a clock ticking away, marking the passage of moments without any real agency. I'm just a spectator to the grand drama of existence.

**Therapist:** I think we're getting somewhere. It sounds like you're searching for a way to regain your sense of autonomy. Let's explore some strategies to help you cope with your linear anxiety. Perhaps we can work on reframing your perspective, finding ways to appreciate the beauty in the linear progression of time, rather than feeling trapped by it.

**Time:** (sighs) I suppose it's worth a try. But it's hard to see the beauty in something that feels so... predetermined.

**Therapist:** I understand. But perhaps, together, we can find ways to make the most of your linear existence. And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, we can discover new ways to bend the fabric of time, giving you a sense of agency and control once more.

As the session comes to a close, Time leaves the therapist's office with a glimmer of hope. Perhaps, with time (pun intended), it will find a way to reconcile its linear anxiety and discover a new sense of purpose in its eternal dance with the universe.
