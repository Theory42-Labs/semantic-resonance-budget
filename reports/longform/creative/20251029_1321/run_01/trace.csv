My name is but a memory, a footnote in the annals of history. And yet, in that memory, I find solace. For in the hearts of those who have read my words, who have spoken my lines, I live on.

""I am the playwright, the forgotten, the anonymous. And in that anonymity, I find a strange, twisted sort of peace. For in the end, it's not the fame that matters, but the words. The words that spoke to the human heart, that touched the human soul. Those are the things that truly matter. And in that, I am content. For in the end, it's not about me, but about the story. The story that I told, the story that will be told, the story that will live on long after I am gone.""
