What a fascinating prompt! Here's a poem that weaves together Latin, Italian, and English to explore the passage of time:

**Inceptio**

In principio, tempus flumen
Flows from the source, the flow of time
Aeternum, immutable, and vast
Eternal, unchanging, and boundless

**Il tempo passa**

Il tempo passa, il tempo scorre
Time passes, time flows
Come il fiume che va al mare
Like the river that goes to the sea
Inarrestabile, inesorabile
Unstoppable, unrelenting

**Time Goes On**

Time goes on, and with it, the years
Roll by like the leaves of a tree
Each one unique, each one brief
A fleeting moment, a sigh
As the seasons come and go
And the world keeps turning, you know

**Il tempo va**

Il tempo va, e con esso gli anni
The time goes, and with it, the years
Passano come foglie di un albero
Pass by like the leaves of a tree
Inarrestabile, inesorabile
Unstoppable, unrelenting

**The Tides of Time**

The tides of time, they ebb and flow
A never-ending cycle, don't you know
As the past recedes, the future grows
And the present moment, it slowly shows
The beauty, the pain, the joy, the strife
The tides of time, they shape our life

In this poem, I've used Latin to represent the beginning of time, with "In principio" and "Aeternum" evoking the eternal and unchanging nature of time. The Italian sections, "Il tempo passa" and "Il tempo va", use the present tense to describe the passage of time, emphasizing its unstoppable and relentless nature. The English sections, "Time Goes On" and "The Tides of Time", use the past and present tenses to reflect on the passage of time, highlighting its fleeting nature and the way it shapes our lives.

I hope you enjoy this poem!
