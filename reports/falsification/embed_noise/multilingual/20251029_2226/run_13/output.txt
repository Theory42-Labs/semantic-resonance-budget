(The stage is dimly lit, with a single spotlight shining down on the speaker. They stand confidently, with a mix of emotions etched on their face. They begin to speak in English.)

"I'm tired of pretending. I'm tired of putting on a mask and hiding behind a smile. I'm tired of being the strong one, the one who never shows weakness. But the truth is, I'm crumbling inside. I'm drowning in my own emotions, and I don't know how to keep my head above water."

(Pause. The speaker takes a deep breath, and their voice shifts to Hindi.)

Translation: "I don't lie, I'm breaking from within. I'm crumbling, my mask is falling apart."

(The speaker's voice cracks, and they pause again, collecting their thoughts.)

"I'm ashamed to admit it, but sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of my own expectations. I'm supposed to be this rock, this pillar of strength, but the truth is, I'm just as fragile as everyone else. I'm just as scared, just as uncertain, just as lost."

(Pause. The speaker's voice returns to English.)

"I know it's not okay to admit these things. I know it's not what people expect from me. But the truth is, honesty is not just about speaking the truth, it's about speaking from the heart. And my heart is breaking, piece by piece, every day."

(Pause. The speaker's voice drops to a whisper.)

"I wish I could be honest in both languages, in both worlds. I wish I could be me, without the need for translation. But for now, I'll keep speaking the truth, in both languages, and hope that someone, somewhere, understands."

(The spotlight fades, and the speaker disappears into the darkness, leaving the audience to ponder the power of emotional honesty and the complexities of language.)
