In the depths of my soul, a spark takes flight
A flame that flickers bright, a beacon in the night
A symbol of hope, a guiding light

In the depths of my soul, a spark takes flight
A flame that flickers bright, a beacon in the night
A symbol of hope, a guiding light
As I embark on this journey, I take flight

Through the valleys of doubt, I wander and roam
Seeking answers to questions that I've yet to call home
The wind whispers secrets, the trees lean in to share
And I listen closely, for the truth is rare

The path unwinds, a labyrinth to explore
A maze of reflections, where I search for more
Of myself, of others, of the world outside
As I weave a tapestry, a story to abide

In the depths of my soul, a spark takes flight
A flame that flickers bright, a beacon in the night
A symbol of hope, a guiding light
As I embark on this journey, I take flight

Through the valleys of doubt, I wander and roam
Seeking answers to questions that I've yet to call home
The wind whispers secrets, the trees lean in to share
And I listen closely, for the truth is rare

The path unwinds, a labyrinth to explore
A maze of reflections, where I search for more
Of myself, of others, of the world outside
As I weave a tapestry, a story to abide

In the depths of my soul, a spark takes flight
A flame that flickers bright, a beacon in the night
A symbol of hope, a guiding light
As I embark on this journey, I take flight

Through the valleys of doubt, I wander and roam
Seeking answers to questions that I've yet to call home

Of myself, of others, of the world outside
