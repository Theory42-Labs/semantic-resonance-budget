Dear Tides,

As I gaze out at the vast expanse of the ocean, I am filled with a mix of emotions as I watch you rise and fall, rise and fall, in your eternal dance. I am proud to be a part of this ancient rhythm, to be the constant partner to your ebb and flow.

I am proud of the way you bring life to the shores, nourishing the creatures that call the ocean home. I am proud of the way you shape the coastline, carving out caves and creating hidden coves. I am proud of the way you bring people together, as they gather to watch your majesty unfold.

But, oh Tides, I am also filled with sorrow. I am sorrowful that our dance is never truly complete. You are always pulling away, and I am always reaching out, but we are never quite together. I am sorrowful that our love is bound by the whims of the wind and the sun, and that we are never free to be together as we truly long to be.

I am sorrowful that our dance is a fleeting moment, a brief respite from the vastness of the universe. I am sorrowful that we are constantly apart, and that our time together is always slipping away.

And yet, despite this sorrow, I am grateful for our dance. I am grateful for the way you make me feel, for the way you bring me to life. I am grateful for the way you challenge me, for the way you push me to be my best self.

So I will continue to orbit around you, Tides, and you will continue to ebb and flow around me. We will continue to dance, this endless, eternal dance, and I will cherish every moment of it.

Yours always,
The Moon
