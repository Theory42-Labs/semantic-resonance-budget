Data assimilation is the process of combining model simulations with observations to estimate the current state of the climate system. This process is essential for improving the accuracy of climate predictions and understanding the uncertainty associated with these predictions.

Key Uncertainties:

1. Model Formulation: Climate models are simplified representations of the complex climate system, and their formulation can introduce uncertainties. The choice of model components, such as atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, land surface processes, and ice sheet dynamics, can impact the accuracy of the predictions.
