Cher amour,

When I first laid eyes on you, I was ensorcelé (enchanted) by your beauty. Your smile could light up a room, and I was hooked from the start. (You lit up the room, and I was hooked from the beginning.)

From that moment on, I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life making you happy. Je t'aime (I love you) with all my heart and soul. You are the sole reason I wake up in the morning, and the last thought on my mind before I drift off to sleep.

As our love grew, I realized that you were more than just a pretty face. Tu eres más que una cara bonita (You are more than just a pretty face). You are kind, caring, and generous, with a heart of gold. Your laughter is music to my ears, and your touch sets my soul on fire.

Now, as we stand together on the threshold of our future, I want you to know that my love for you knows no bounds. Je t'adore (I adore you) more with each passing day. You are my everything, my raison d'être (my reason for being). Without you, life would be dull and grey, but with you, every day is a masterpiece, a obra de arte (a work",0.003765,0.448486,0.447437,0.039913,0.8,0.95
