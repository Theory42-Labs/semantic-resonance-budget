Here are the translations:

**English:** "The sky remembers every storm."
**Japanese:** (Ten wa araware shi no kioku o tsukamu)
**Hawaiian:** "Ka lā i mālama iā ka maʻa."
**Spanish:** "El cielo recuerda cada tormenta."

Now, let's explore how each language's worldview influences the emotional tone of the proverb:

**English:** In English, the phrase "The sky remembers every storm" has a sense of vastness and eternity. The word "sky" implies a boundless expanse, and "remembers" suggests a sense of judgment or record-keeping. This translation conveys a somewhat ominous tone, implying that the consequences of our actions will be recorded and remembered forever.

**Japanese:** In Japanese, the phrase (Ten wa araware shi no kioku o tsukamu) has a more poetic and atmospheric tone. The word "araware" (荒涯) means "wild" or "rough," which adds a sense of turbulence to the phrase. The verb "tsukamu" (つかむ) means "to grasp" or "to hold," implying a sense of containment or restraint. This translation conveys a sense of the sky as a dynamic, powerful force that can hold and remember the intensity of the storm.

**Hawaiian:** In Hawaiian, the phrase "Ka lā i mālama iā ka maʻa" has a more intimate and nurturing tone. The word "lā" (sky) is often associated with the divine or spiritual realm, and "mālama" (to care for or protect) implies a sense of gentle guidance. The phrase suggests that the sky is not just a witness to the storm but a caregiver that helps to nurture and protect us during turbulent times. This translation conveys a sense of trust and comfort.

**Spanish:** In Spanish, the phrase "El cielo recuerda cada tormenta" has a more dramatic and intense tone. The word "cielo" (sky) is often associated with the infinite and the divine, and "recuerda" (remembers) implies a sense of sharp memory and attention. The phrase suggests that the sky is a keen observer that remembers every detail of the storm, which can be both intimidating and awe-inspiring. This translation conveys a sense of reverence and respect for the power of nature.

In summary, each language's worldview influences the emotional tone of the proverb by emphasizing different aspects of the relationship between the sky and the storm. English emphasizes the vastness and judgmental nature of the sky, Japanese emphasizes the dynamic and powerful force of the sky, Hawaiian emphasizes the nurturing and protective qualities of the sky, and Spanish emphasizes the intense and awe-inspiring power of the sky.
