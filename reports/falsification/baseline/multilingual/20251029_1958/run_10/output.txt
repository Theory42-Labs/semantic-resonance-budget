As I sat on the beach, I couldn't help but think about my childhood. Eu me lembro de quando eu era um garoto, jogando futebol com meus amigos no parque. (I remember when I was a boy, playing soccer with my friends in the park.) The sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the waves. 

But as I gazed out at the sea, my mind began to wander. Nunca mais havia estado tão longe de casa, tão longe de minha família. (I had never been so far from home, so far from my family.) The words blurred together, and I struggled to recall my name, my face, my life..

 Suddenly, I was transported to a bustling street in Seoul.???????! (What's going on?! This is crazy!) The sounds of honking horns and chattering pedestrians swirled around me, but I couldn't make sense of it. My memory was slipping away, like grains of sand between my fingers.

As I stumbled through the crowded streets, I caught a glimpse of a familiar face.???????? (I think I know that person!) But before I could approach her, everything went dark. Eu me perdi, perdi o meu caminho, perdi minha memória. (I lost myself, lost my way, lost my memory.)

When I came to, I was back on the beach, the sun dipping below the horizon. But something was different. I couldn't recall my name, my parents, my childhood. The only thing I knew was the feel of the sand between my toes, the taste of the salty air..???
