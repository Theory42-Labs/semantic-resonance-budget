One day, while experimenting with a new technique, Lena stumbled upon something unexpected. She had been layering glazes on a canvas, creating a rich, iridescent sheen, when she suddenly felt a strange sensation in her eyes.

One day, while experimenting with a new technique, Lena stumbled upon something unexpected.
