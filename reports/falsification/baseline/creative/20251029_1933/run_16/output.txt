In twilight's hush, where echoes fade to dark,
A city's whispers linger, lost in the spark
Of memories that danced upon the breeze,
A civilization's dreams, like autumn leaves.

No chronicles remain, no written tales,
To tell the story of their mortal gales,
No script to unravel, no ink to stain,
Their history, a mystery, forever in vain.

Their artistry, a whispered rumor spreads,
A people skilled in crafts, in whispers said,
Their pottery, a testament to skill and art,
A reflection of a culture, lost from the heart.

Their language, a dialect, forever silenced,
A tongue that spoke of life, now forever compromised,
Their music, a melody, that echoes through the void,
A haunting refrain, of a people, no longer employed.

Their daily life, a tapestry, so fine and bright,
Weaves stories of a people, in the fading light,
Their joys and struggles, their triumphs and their fears,
All lost, as the sands of time, their civilization clears.

Their memory, a fleeting thought, a whisper in the wind,
A civilization, that vanished, before its time, left behind,
A legacy, of what could have been, a tale untold,
A people, who lived, and left, their story untold.

In twilight's hush, where echoes fade to dark,
Their legacy remains, a mystery, left in the spark,
A civilization, that vanished, before its time, a tale,
A story, that will forever, remain, in the silence, and the pale.
