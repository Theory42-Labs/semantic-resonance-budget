In the village of Ashkhan, nestled in the heart of a dense forest, a peculiar tradition has been passed down for generations. The villagers believe that names are a burden, a source of individuality that can lead to conflict and division. Instead, they have adopted a unique way of living where identity is shared like fire.

In Ashkhan, every villager is known by a single, collective name: "The People." Each resident is assigned a unique role or characteristic, such as "The Healer," "The Hunter," or "The Weaver," and this title becomes their identity. This system is designed to promote unity and cooperation, as everyone works together towards the well-being of the community.

When a child is born, they are given a small, intricately carved wooden token with their assigned role etched onto it. As they grow, they learn to embody the qualities and skills associated with their title. The villagers believe that by shedding individual names, they can transcend personal desires and ambitions, and instead focus on the greater good.

The village is organized into a complex network of roles, with each person contributing their unique skills to the community. The Healer tends to the sick, the Hunter provides food, and the Weaver crafts beautiful textiles. This shared identity also allows for easy rotation of tasks, as anyone can take on a role if needed.

To maintain this system, the villagers have developed a unique way of addressing one another. When speaking to someone, they use phrases like "The Healer's hand is strong" or "The Weaver's threads are beautiful." This way, they acknowledge the person's role without acknowledging their individual name.

This shared identity has several benefits. Conflicts are rare, as everyone is working towards the same goal. The villagers also have a deep sense of belonging, as they are all part of a larger whole. Additionally, the lack of individual names has led to a remarkable lack of jealousy and competition, as everyone knows that their worth is not tied to their personal achievements.

However, this system is not without its challenges. Newcomers to the village often struggle to adapt, as they are not accustomed to the absence of individual names. The villagers have developed a process to help newcomers integrate, involving a series of trials and challenges that test their skills and willingness to adopt the collective identity.

In Ashkhan, the concept of identity is fluid and shared. The villagers believe that by embracing their roles, they can create a harmonious and thriving community. As they work together, their collective identity burns bright, a beacon of cooperation and unity in a world where individuality can often lead to division.
