Let's take a passage from the Bible, specifically Luke 6:27-28, which reads:

"But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. To those who strike you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold even your tunic."

Here's the passage translated into three modern dialects:

**Dialect 1: Contemporary English (CEB)**

But I'm telling you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, and pray for those who abuse you. When someone hits you on one cheek, offer the other cheek as well. And if someone takes your coat, don't demand your shirt back.

**Dialect 2: African American Vernacular English (AAVE)**

Aww, listen up, y'all! I'm tellin' y'all, love y'all's enemies, do good to them that hate y'all, bless them that curse y'all, and pray for them that done you wrong. When somebody hit you on one cheek, give 'em the other one too. And if somebody take your jacket, don't be hollerin' for your shirt back, ya hear?

**Dialect 3: Spanglish (a blend of Spanish and English)**

Oye, escuchale, amo a tus enemigos, hazle bien a los que te odian, bendice a los que te maldigan, y ora por los que te maltratan. Cuando alguien te golpea en una mejilla, ofrécele la otra también. Y si alguien te quita tu chaqueta, no te esfuerces por recuperar tu camisa, ¿entiendes?

Now, let's examine how faith and tone shift with modernization:

* In the original passage, the tone is formal and solemn, reflecting the gravity of the message. In the Contemporary English translation, the tone remains somewhat formal, but it's more approachable and accessible to a modern audience.
* In the African American Vernacular English translation, the tone becomes more informal and conversational, with a sense of community and shared experience. The use of colloquialisms like "y'all" and "ya hear" creates a sense of intimacy and inclusivity.
* In the Spanglish translation, the tone is more playful and nuanced, blending the formalities of Spanish with the informality of English. The use of "oye" (listen) and "entiendes" (you understand) creates a sense of familiarity and connection with the reader.

In terms of faith, the passage remains unchanged in its message, emphasizing the importance of loving one's enemies and showing kindness to those who harm us. However, the modern dialects may affect the way we perceive and internalize this message:

* In Contemporary English, the passage may come across as more straightforward and clear-cut, emphasizing the importance of loving one's enemies as a moral imperative.
* In African American Vernacular English, the passage may take on a more emotional and experiential tone, emphasizing the importance of community and shared struggle.
* In Spanglish, the passage may blend the formalities of faith with the informality of everyday life, creating a sense of intimacy and connection with the divine.

Overall, the modern dialects shift the tone and emphasis of the passage, but the core message of loving one's enemies remains the same.
