In the amour de l'âme (love of the soul)

And the Schadenfreude (joy in others' misfortune) of self-doubt festers

In this Prozess (process) of self-discovery
I find solace in the Tao (way) of letting go
Of the Fata Morgana (mirage) of expectations
And the Samsara of attachments

As the Kintsugi (golden joinery) of brokenness
Heals the cracks in my Seelengefühl (soul feeling)
I find myself in the nowhere and everywhere
Of the Nietzschean Übermensch (superhuman)

Whatever I wish to be, without the constraints
Of the language barriers that once confined me

The poem starts with French and German, blending words to create a sense of love and introspection. As it progresses, it incorporates Sanskrit and Tibetan words to explore the idea of self-discovery and the fleeting nature of time. The poem then takes a turn into German and Nietzschean philosophy, using words like ""Übermensch"" to describe the idea of becoming something greater than oneself. Finally, it concludes with a sense of liberation, where the speaker is free to become whatever they wish, unencumbered by the constraints of language and identity.
