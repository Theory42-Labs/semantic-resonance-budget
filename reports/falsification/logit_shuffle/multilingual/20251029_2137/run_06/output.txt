[Scene: A quiet, moonlit forest. Two individuals, Ásta and Jón, stand facing each other, their voices barely above a whisper.]

Ásta: (in a hazy, dreamlike tone) "Fregnir á mátt?" (What do you want?)

Jón: (in a distant, echoey voice) "Svona eru fyrir mig. Ég vil þú vita..." (It's for me. I want to know...)

Ásta: (her voice fading in and out) "Kleifar á tvöfalt..." (Gates on two levels...)

Jón: (his voice growing stronger) "Já, já. Og þú?" (Yes, yes. And you?)

Ásta: (her words slurring) "Kærlukvísl..." (Love's whisper...)

Jón: (his voice cracking) "Ég kann ekkert. Ég kann ekkert..." (I know nothing. I know nothing...)

[As they speak, their words blend and blur, the English and Icelandic phrases merging into a dreamlike language. Ásta's voice grows stronger, her words becoming more urgent.]

Ásta: (with increasing clarity) "Vér þrjóast í sameiningu... Verið á móti" (We are lost in unity... Be against it)

Jón: (his voice resonating) "Já, þú ert mig. Ég er þú" (Yes, you are me. I am you)

[Their words become clearer, the language shifting seamlessly between English and Icelandic. Ásta's eyes lock onto Jón's, and they step closer, their faces inches apart.]

Ásta: (with conviction) "Við eru einu. Við eru saman" (We are one. We are together)

Jón: (with equal conviction) "Ja, við eru. Og við eru koma" (Yes, we are. And we are coming)

[As they speak, the dreamlike quality fades, and their voices become clear and distinct. Ásta and Jón's faces blend into a single, glowing image, their words merging into a single, harmonious language.]

Ásta: (with a soft, tender tone) "I understand you now."

Jón: (with a gentle, reassuring tone) "And I understand you."

[The scene fades to black, the sound of their whispers lingering in the air.]
