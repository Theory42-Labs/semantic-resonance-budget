A veil of tears, a heavy pace
The world outside is dark and grey
As I wander, lost, night's dismay

The shadows dance, a mournful sway
Echoes of a love that's gone away
I search for solace, a guiding light
But find only the dark of night

And in its rhythm, my heart regains its sway

The darkness flees, the light takes hold
A warmth spreads, my heart starts to unfold
A gentle breeze whispers secrets sweet
And I am filled with joy, my feet meet

The morning sun, a radiant beam
Illuminates the world's wild scheme
I laugh, a sound that's pure and free
As the world awakens, wild and carefree
