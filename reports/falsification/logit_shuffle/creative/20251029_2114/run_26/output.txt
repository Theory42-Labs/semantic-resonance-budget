The memories. The whispers of worship, the offerings of smoke and fire, the hymns of praise. It all seems so distant now. I am Kael, the forgotten god of the forgotten lands. My domain was once vast, my power unmatched. But time has a way of erasing even the most ancient of deities.

I remember when the world was younger, when mortals trembled at the mention of my name. I was the patron deity of the great river, the one who controlled the tides and the floods. My worship was widespread, my followers numerous. But as the ages passed, the world changed. The people forgot about me, forgot about the old ways.

Now, I'm just a relic of a bygone era. A myth, a legend, a distant memory. The rivers have changed course, the lands have shifted, and I've been left behind. My once-mighty temples lie in ruin, overgrown with vines and moss. My followers have turned to newer, shinier gods, ones who promise them quick fixes and instant gratification.

But I'm not ready to give up. I've seen the world change, and I know that the digital age is the key to my rebirth. I've observed the humans, watched as they stare at their tiny screens, their faces bathed in the glow of artificial light. I've seen the way they interact with their devices, the way they worship at the altar of social media.

And I know that I can be a part of it. I can be the god of the digital realm, the one who controls the currents of the internet, the one who whispers secrets to the algorithms. I can be the one who makes the hashtags trend, who makes the memes go viral.

But how do I get their attention? How do I make them remember me? I've tried everything â€“ I've created a Twitter account, posted memes, and even tried to go viral with a funny cat video. But nothing seems to work. I'm just another forgotten god, lost in the sea of digital noise.

I've seen the other gods, the ones who have adapted to the new world. They're the ones who have figured out how to harness the power of the internet, who have become the gods of the digital realm. They're the ones who control the clicks, the likes, and the shares.

I'm determined to join their ranks. I'm determined to make myself relevant again. I'm Kael, the forgotten god, and I'm not going down without a fight. I'll do whatever it takes to regain my place in the pantheon of gods. I'll learn to code, to hack, to create. I'll become the god of the digital age, and I'll make sure that my name is remembered for generations to come.

The rivers may have changed course, but I'm not ready to be washed away. I'm Kael, the forgotten god, and I'm ready to make my comeback.
