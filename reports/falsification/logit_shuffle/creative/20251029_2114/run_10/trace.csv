And so, silence was born. The gods, exhausted by their argument, slumbered, and the world was left to nurse its wounds. From that day forward, silence became a tangible force, a reminder of the power of discord and the importance of harmony.

Among them was the goddess of sound, Melodia, who brought forth the first harmonious melodies to fill the void. Her brother, the god of chaos, Discordia, was not pleased with the serenity that surrounded him.

Discordia, fueled by his own discontent, began to stir the primordial soup of emotions, creating discordant notes that clashed with Melodia's harmonies. The gods, initially amused by the novelty, soon grew annoyed by the cacophony that filled the air.

Melodia, offended by her brother's disruption, stood firm and countered with a divine melody that sought to drown out Discordia's din. The two gods clashed, their sounds intertwining in a battle of wits and artistry.

As the argument raged on, the world began to take shape. The earth trembled, the skies darkened, and the oceans churned with turbulent waves. The other gods, tired of the commotion, fled to the farthest corners of the realm, seeking refuge from the aural chaos.

As the dispute reached its climax, the gods' voices became one with the very fabric of reality. The world began to vibrate with the conflicting energies, and the sound of their argument took on a life of its own. It grew louder, swelling to a deafening crescendo that shook the foundations of the universe.

In that moment, the gods realized that their quarrel had created something new, something that had never existed before: silence. The cacophony had reached a point where no sound could be heard, as if the very essence of noise had exhausted itself.

And so, silence was born. The gods, exhausted by their argument, slumbered, and the world was left to nurse its wounds. From that day forward, silence became a tangible force, a reminder of the power of discord and the importance of harmony.

As the ages passed, the gods learned to respect the value of silence, using it to meditate, to heal, and to communicate with each other in a language that transcended the limitations of sound.
