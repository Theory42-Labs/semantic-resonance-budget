Prompt 23: Explain how black holes test the limits of general relativity. What paradoxes emerge when combining relativity with quantum field theory?

Prompt 24: Consider the relationship between mathematics and physical reality. To what extent is math discovered versus invented?

Prompt 25: Describe the concept of phase transitions in matter and how it relates to critical phenomena. Provide an example of a non-physical system that exhibits similar behavior.

Prompt 26: Examine how deep learning models process uncertainty compared to human intuition. What does this reveal about the nature of reasoning and understanding?

Prompt 27: Discuss the role of entropy and information in the evolution of the universe. Could information be a fundamental constituent of physical reality?

Prompt 28: Explain how ecological resilience is measured and maintained. What lessons from natural ecosystems can inform human systems design?

Prompt 29: Reflect on the philosophy of measurement. What does it mean for a quantity to be “observable,” and how do limits of observation shape scientific truth?

Prompt 30: Analyze the concept of emergence in AI consciousness. Could a sufficiently complex system develop awareness spontaneously, or is subjective experience irreducible?
