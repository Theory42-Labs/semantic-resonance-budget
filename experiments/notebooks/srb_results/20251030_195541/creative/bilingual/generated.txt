Write a short poem alternating lines in English and Japanese (romaji ok). Avoid repeating phrases and favor metaphor. 

English:  
In the silence of dawn, whispers  
Of the night depart, leaving stars  
To wink like distant, sleepy eyes.  

Japanese: 
Yume no shizukana ashita,  
Kokoro ga kaze ni natte  
Tobu yo no atsui yume.  

English:
In fields where dreams once danced,  
Now only the wind's soft breath  
Whispers tales of fleeting grace.  

Japanese:
Yama no naka no yoru no  
Tsuzuki ga mizui koe  
Sasageyo, tsunagi wa saku.  

English:
And time itself, a river's flow,  
Carries us towards the unknown  
With gentle strength and slow push.  

Japanese:
Michi no mizu, ki to wa  
Tsubasa o ita kaze no  
Nakayoru kuchibiki.  

English:
So let us sail, hearts light as foam,  
Beneath the vast, unending blue,  
Embraced by skies of endless hue.  

Japanese:
Fumiage yo, kokoro no  
Hana no nageire, nagisa no  
Ashi no yoru made iru.
